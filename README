config file code by Rick Wagner wagnerr@umich.edu from http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wagnerr/ConfigFile.html

Requirements:
Linux uinput interface in kernel
Linux Joystick interface in kernel
Some type of joystick or gamepad that plays nicely with linux

Currently Implemented Features:
Multiple Modes for input
Basic Alpha/Numeric input
Useful handling of Special characters (alt, shift, ctrl, meta, cap, scroll, num locks )
macros (partially supported)
Config file support (Basic)

Todo:
macros should be easy to define in config file
support for key repeating
Helper application support
add button mapping helper support

Similar Software:
joy2key - joy2key uses x events to send output, if you'd prefer this instead of uinput look at joy2key http://interreality.org/~tetron/technology/joy2key/

joymouse - translates joystick events to mouse events. http://sourceforge.net/projects/joymouse-linux
