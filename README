config file code by Rick Wagner wagnerr@umich.edu from http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wagnerr/ConfigFile.html

Requirements:
Linux uinput interface in kernel
Linux Joystick interface in kernel
Some type of joystick or gamepad that plays nicely with linux

Currently Implemented Features:
Multiple Modes for input
Basic Alpha/Numeric input
Useful handling of Special characters (alt, shift, ctrl, meta, cap, scroll, num locks ) ( hold all modifiers down untill a non modifier is pressed )
Config file support (Basic)
Calibration assitance ( run with -b and joy2chord will tell you what button number you pressed)

Todo:
macros should be easy to define in config file
support for key repeating
Helper application support

Similar Software:
joy2key - joy2key uses x events to send output, if you'd prefer this instead of uinput look at joy2key http://interreality.org/~tetron/technology/joy2key/

joymouse - translates joystick events to mouse events. http://sourceforge.net/projects/joymouse-linux

mxk - an input evdev/uinput mangling server, http://welz.org.za/projects/mxk
